\section{Fusion Energy System Studies}

\subsection{Nuclear Analysis}

Nuclear analysis of candidate fusion energy systems has always been an
important aspect of these studies, with particular attention to nuclear
heating, radiation damage, tritium breeding, decay heat removal and waste
management.  Historically, 1-D analysis has been used for scoping potential
design options with 3-D analysis used to probe specific scenarios once a
design has been selected.  Because of the need to generate 3-D models for
nucler analysis, the UW team has become the primary organization for
generating such models.  During this reporting period this kind of analysis
has been completed on the ARIES-ACT-1/2 and FESS-FNSF concepts.  The results
of these nuclear analyses often drive other important design aspects of the
overall system.

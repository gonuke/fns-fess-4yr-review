\section{Summary}

The \gls{UW-FTI} is pursing an increasingly-integrated research program of
software development for predictive nuclear analysis combined with nuclear
analysis and design of fusion energy systems.  This combination allows the
analysis experience to influence the software development priorities and
allows the analysts to have immediate access to the latest software
developments.

This project and its predecessors have been the primary support for the
development of a leading CAD-based Monte Carlo radiation transport capability
for the US fusion neutronics community, and, until recently\cite{serpentCAD},
the only capability that directly uses high-fidelity CAD-based surface
representation for MC radiation transport in the world.  Continued performance
enhancements draw from a wide body of literature in computer graphics, meshing
and computer science.  Ongoing capability extensions are addressing the
fundamental needs

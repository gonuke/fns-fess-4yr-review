\chapter{Program Narrative}

%% PROGRAM NARRATIVE: The Program Narrative should summarize details of the
%% program over the performance period.  The specific content of the narrative is
%% not prescribed, but should instead focus on providing sufficient information
%% to judge the progress of the program with respect to the review criteria
%% described in Attachment 2.  It should be written concisely and convey all
%% information at a relatively high level.  Where possible this report should not
%% duplicate information available in publications, and should instead cite
%% reference as appropriate.

%% Additionally, programs should expect that reviewers are familiar with
%% challenges in the field and the report should only contain enough introductory
%% material as in necessary to justify the tasks and objectives presented in the
%% narrative.  The bulk of the narrative should focus on providing a clear
%% statement of the specific tasks, themes, and objectives of the program, and
%% succinctly highlight accomplishments made under the performance period with
%% regards to these items.  A timeline for the major activities and
%% accomplishments of the program over the performance period should also be
%% included.

%% The project narrative MUST NOT EXCEED 10 PAGES IN LENGHT, including charts,
%% graphs, maps, photographs, and other pictorial presentations, when printed
%% using standard 8.5” by 11” paper with 1 inch margins (top, bottom, left, and
%% right). The font must not be smaller than 11 point.

\chapter{Program Narrative}

%% PROGRAM NARRATIVE: The Program Narrative should summarize details of the
%% program over the performance period.  The specific content of the narrative is
%% not prescribed, but should instead focus on providing sufficient information
%% to judge the progress of the program with respect to the review criteria
%% described in Attachment 2.  It should be written concisely and convey all
%% information at a relatively high level.  Where possible this report should not
%% duplicate information available in publications, and should instead cite
%% reference as appropriate.

%% Additionally, programs should expect that reviewers are familiar with
%% challenges in the field and the report should only contain enough introductory
%% material as in necessary to justify the tasks and objectives presented in the
%% narrative.  The bulk of the narrative should focus on providing a clear
%% statement of the specific tasks, themes, and objectives of the program, and
%% succinctly highlight accomplishments made under the performance period with
%% regards to these items.  A timeline for the major activities and
%% accomplishments of the program over the performance period should also be
%% included.

%% The project narrative MUST NOT EXCEED 10 PAGES IN LENGHT, including charts,
%% graphs, maps, photographs, and other pictorial presentations, when printed
%% using standard 8.5” by 11” paper with 1 inch margins (top, bottom, left, and
%% right). The font must not be smaller than 11 point.

%% 1. Scientific and/or Technical Merit of the Project 
%% - What was the scientific/technical merit of the program? 
%% - What were the scientific/technical goals of the program? Are they sufficiently
%%   ambitious and has meaningful progress been made towards those goals during the
%%   performance period?
%% - How did the program compare with other research in its field in terms of
%%   scientific/technical merit, originality, and uniqueness? 
%% 2. Appropriateness of the Proposed Method or Approach 
%% - How logical and feasible were the research approaches? 
%% - Were the conceptual framework, methods, and analyses well justified, adequately
%%   developed, and comprehensive enough to produce scientifically valid conclusions? 
%% - How did the program approach potential problems, mitigate risks, and consider
%%   alternative strategies? 
%% 3. Competency of Personnel and Adequacy of Resources 
%% - How well qualified were the personnel to carry out the research?
%% - Were the resources (personnel, facilities, and budget) adequate for performing the
%%   research scope?
%% - Were the program leadership and resource management effective and efficient?
%% 4. Relevance and Impact
%% - How did the program contribute to the mission of the FES program during the
%%   performance period?
%% - How has the program impacted the field of fusion science and technology during the
%%   performance period?
%% - Has the program adequately disseminated scientific results through publications in
%%   peer-reviewed journals, meetings and conference presentations, workshops, or other
%%   appropriate means?
%% - Are there additional areas of impact that should be considered when evaluating this %%   program (e.g. educational benefits, contributions to other scientific fields,
%%   leadership activities, etc.)?

	abstract = {The MCR2S system is a tool for the analysis of activation dose in ITER and fusion devices based on the rigorous-2-step formalism, MCNP mesh-tallies and the FISPACT nuclear inventory code. It couples transport and activation calculations in an integrated manner, allowing for the necessarily fine energy and spatial resolutions required for this kind of analysis and overcoming limitations of previous similar tools. The system is routinely used at UKAEA to assist the design of several ITER components such as the ICRH heating system and LIDAR diagnostic. Here we describe its functionality and a first benchmark exercise performed using the fusion-relevant Frascati Neutron Generator shutdown dose rate experiment results. Neutron spectra, reaction rates, photon spectra and activation decay dose rates at several positions and times, obtained using FENDL-2.1/MC and EAF-2007 data, are presented and compared to those of earlier software and libraries, showing good agreement. C/E values close to unity are obtained in all cases, illustrating the robustness and reliability of this novel software. 2009 A. Davis.},

ALARA offers improvement over DKR because it is able to accurately model loops in the decay trees and calculate gas production.

	abstract = {In fusion energy systems (FES) neutrons are born from a burning plasma and subsequently activate surrounding system components. The photon dose rate after shutdown from the resultant radionuclides must be quantified for maintenance planning. This shutdown dose rate (SDR) is calculated by coupling neutron transport, activation analysis, and photon transport. The size, complexity, and attenuating configuration of FES motivate the use of hybrid Monte Carlo (MC)/deterministic neutron transport. The Multi-Step Consistent Adjoint Driven Importance Sampling (MS-CADIS) method can be used to optimize MC neutron transport for this purpose. This requires the formulation of an adjoint neutron source that approximates the transmutation process. In this work one such formulation is introduced which is valid when a specific set of transmutation criteria are met, referred to as the Single Neutron Interaction and Low Burnup (SNILB) criteria. These criteria are quantitatively evaluated for typical FES scenarios and are shown to be met within a reasonable margin. Groupwise Transmutation (GT)-CADIS, proposed here, is an implementation of MS-CADIS that calculates this adjoint neutron source using a series of irradiation calculations. For a simple SDR problem, GT-CADIS provides speedups of 200 ± 100 relative to global variance reduction with the Forward Weighted (FW)-CADIS method and 90,000 ± 50,000 relative to analog. When the SNILB criteria are egregiously violated, GT-CADIS modifications are proposed and are shown to provide significant performance improvements. Finally, GT-CADIS is applied to a production-level problem involving a Spherical Tokamak Fusion Nuclear Science Facility (ST-FNSF) device. This work shows that GT-CADIS is broadly applicable to FES scenarios and will significantly reduce the computational resources necessary for SDR analysis.},

	abstract = {In fusion energy systems (FES) high-energy neutrons born from burning plasma activate system components to form radionuclides. The biological dose rate that results from photons emitted by these radionuclides after shutdown—the shutdown dose rate (SDR)—must be quantified for maintenance planning. This can be done using the Rigorous Two-Step (R2S) method, which involves separate neutron and photon transport calculations, coupled by a nuclear inventory analysis code. The geometric complexity and highly attenuating configuration of FES motivates the use of CAD geometry and advanced variance
reduction for this analysis.

An R2S workflow has been created with the new capability of performing SDR analysis directly from CAD geometry with Cartesian or tetrahedral meshes and with biased photon source sampling, enabling
the use of the Consistent Adjoint Driven Importance Sampling (CADIS) variance reduction technique. This workflow has been validated with the Frascati Neutron Generator (FNG)-ITER SDR benchmark using both Cartesian and tetrahedral meshes and both unbiased and biased photon source sampling. All results are
within 20.4\% of experimental values, which constitutes satisfactory agreement. Photon transport using
CADIS is demonstrated to yield speedups as high as 8.5·10{\textasciicircum}5 for problems using the FNG geometry.},

In this work, two ITER realistic benchmark calculation models are used to determine the impact on nuclear heating by the cross section library used in the calculation.

This paper outlines several major nuclear issues addressed for the recently completed ARIES-ACT1 tokamak conceptual power plant study. An integral nuclear approach was deemed necessary to deliver an optimal design. This approach considered the overall configuration, design requirements (including tritium self-sufficiency), smart selection of low-activation material for all components, radial build optimization and definition, and safety and environmental concerns.

	abstract = {This paper reports the main results of the activation analysis of the ARIES-ACT1 power plant and its attractive environmental characteristics. The approach aims at examining several activation-related effects that influence the neutron-induced radioactivity, decay heat, waste classification, recyclability, and clearability of radioactive materials. Detailed studies are presented and provide information about the interdependence of material choices and activation response functions. It is also shown how the activation analysis can help address the inboard decay heat problem, one of the most important safety-related issues for tokamaks, and point the way to proper solutions through redefining the radial build to meet the design needs. Furthermore, the study suggests an integral management strategy to change what is now a costly waste disposal concern for fusion into a valued commodity via the further development of the recycling and clearance approaches.},

	abstract = {The ARIES team is currently proposing two tungsten divertor concepts for its tokamak designs and has performed extensive analyses to optimize their thermal and structural performance. Because of the high divertor operating temperatures and the low ductility of tungsten, thermal creep and fracture will be important failure mechanisms to consider. This paper presents a series of finite element analyses addressing the viable operating ranges of these tungsten plate divertor concepts with respect to creep and fracture. For fracture, the J-integral, a path-independent contour integral that estimates the strain energy release rate for a crack of assumed geometry, is used to address crack propagation. Elliptical surface cracks are introduced both inside and outside the coolant channel, and steady-state calculations are carried out for both full-power and cold shutdown conditions. It is determined that the critical crack is on the inside of the coolant channel with the highest stress intensities at full-power operation. Also, transient creep simulations are performed to predict the high-temperature thermal deformations and creep strains at various surface flux levels. Finally, transient thermal calculations are carried out to simulate edge-localized modes in the plasma, and conclusions are drawn with respect to the severity and frequency of these events with respect to surface melting for the two concepts.},

	abstract = {Previous work has addressed the thermomechanical and electromagnetic effects of ELMs and disruptions on plasma-facing components in conceptual, commercial fusion reactors. Given that the proposed Fusion Nuclear Science Facility (FNSF) will have different geometry and plasma parameters, it is necessary to address similar issues in that context. Hence, this paper presents two key results: the thermomechanical response of the first wall and divertor to expected FNSF ELMs and disruptions, and the electromagnetic response of all structures inside the FNSF vacuum vessel to a plasma current quench. Structures considered in the electromagnetic analyses include the vacuum vessel, blankets, structural ring (which supports many of the internal components), and all internal shells used for plasma stability and control. The first wall is a ferritic steel structure with a thin tungsten coating and the divertor is all tungsten. Properties used for the divertor are those of pure tungsten, though it is quite possible that some alloy or nanostructured material would be employed at some point. Both the first wall and divertor are gas-cooled, so coolant pressures are quite high (8–10MPa). The finite element code ANSYS is used to carry out all analyses and parametric studies are employed in order to identify parameters for which uncertainties will have a significant effect on the predicted performance. The ELM and disruption loads are found to be substantially smaller than those expected in a commercial reactor, so the component designs have more margin.},

The objective of this work is to develop a multiphysics modeling process in order to optimize the design and achieve long lifetime, maintainability, and high reliability. 3D finite element multiphysics modeling of the DCLL first wall and blanket (midplane of one sector) has been performed using COMSOL 5.2. The multiphysics aspect of the design is demonstrated via coupling of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), conjugate heat transfer and solid mechanics. Both normal and off-normal loading conditions have been analyzed. The results of velocity, pressure, and temperature distributions of helium flow, as well as the primary and thermal stress of the structure were obtained. This was followed by determination of the factors of safety along three critical paths based on the ITER Structural Design Criteria for In-vessel Components (ISDC-IC). We show here that the structural design meets the ITER-ISDC design rules under both normal and off-normal operating conditions, though the safety factors under off-normal condition with 8MPa helium pressure are marginal. Thus simple design optimization was conducted based on a parametric study on first wall dimensions to improve the design.},

Up to ∽8\% metallic transmutants are generated at the expected lifetime of the fusion blanket. Irradiation in fission reactors to the same fast neutron fluence yields a much larger amount of metallic transmutation products than in fusion systems. While the dominant component in fusion systems is rhenium (Re), osmium (Os) is the main transmutation product in fission reactors. The impact on the W properties needs to be assessed. The results of this work will help guide irradiation experiments in fission reactors to properly simulate the conditions in fusion systems by possible direct implantation of transmutation products in irradiated samples. In addition, the results represent a necessary input for modeling activities aimed at understanding the expected effects on properties.},

	abstract = {A novel approach for the Monte Carlo based calculation of high resolution shutdown dose rate distributions was elaborated at KIT developing the previous R2Smesh technique. The method utilizes the MCNP code for particle transport calculations and the FISPACT code for the activity calculations providing the decay photon source distribution. The spatial distributions both of neutrons and decay photons are obtained by making use of the mesh tally technique available with MCNP5. This procedure has no limitation for the complexity of the geometry used for particle transport simulations. As a unique novelty, the present approach does not need a particle track output (PTRAC) file for the determination of the material composition in a mesh element. Instead a newly developed subroutine, linked to the MCNP code, takes care about the geometry cells, materials and their volume fractions in the mesh cell passing this information directly to the MCNP's mesh tally output file. The new approach is verified by means of benchmark calculations for JET and compared to the cell based rigorous 2 step (R2S) method. The results obtained fit very well experimental data. The successful application of the new interface to JET has demonstrated that this approach can be applied with confidence for shutdown dose rate assessments in ITER.},

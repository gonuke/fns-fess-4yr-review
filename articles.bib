	abstract = {In fusion energy systems (FES) high-energy neutrons born from burning plasma activate system components to form radionuclides. The biological dose rate that results from photons emitted by these radionuclides after shutdown—the shutdown dose rate (SDR)—must be quantified for maintenance planning. This can be done using the Rigorous Two-Step (R2S) method, which involves separate neutron and photon transport calculations, coupled by a nuclear inventory analysis code. The geometric complexity and highly attenuating configuration of FES motivates the use of CAD geometry and advanced variance
reduction for this analysis.

An R2S workflow has been created with the new capability of performing SDR analysis directly from CAD geometry with Cartesian or tetrahedral meshes and with biased photon source sampling, enabling
the use of the Consistent Adjoint Driven Importance Sampling (CADIS) variance reduction technique. This workflow has been validated with the Frascati Neutron Generator (FNG)-ITER SDR benchmark using both Cartesian and tetrahedral meshes and both unbiased and biased photon source sampling. All results are
within 20.4\% of experimental values, which constitutes satisfactory agreement. Photon transport using
CADIS is demonstrated to yield speedups as high as 8.5·10{\textasciicircum}5 for problems using the FNG geometry.},

	abstract = {In fusion energy systems (FES) neutrons born from burning plasma activate system components. The photon dose rate after shutdown from resulting radionuclides must be quantified. This shutdown dose rate
(SDR) is calculated by coupling neutron transport, activation analysis, and photon transport. The size, complexity, and attenuating configuration of FES motivate the use of hybrid Monte Carlo (MC)/deterministic
neutron transport. The Multi-Step Consistent Adjoint Driven Importance Sampling (MS-CADIS) method can be used to optimize MC neutron transport for coupled multiphysics problems, including SDR analysis, using
deterministic estimates of adjoint flux distributions. When used for SDR analysis, MS-CADIS requires the formulation of an adjoint neutron source that approximates the transmutation process. In this work, transmutation approximations are used to derive a solution for this adjoint neutron source. It is shown that these approximations are reasonably met for typical FES neutron spectra and materials over a range of irradiation scenarios. When these approximations are met, the Groupwise Transmutation (GT)-CADIS method, proposed
here, can be used effectively. GT-CADIS is an implementation of the MS-CADIS method for SDR analysis that uses a series of single-energy-group irradiations to calculate the adjoint neutron source. For a simple SDR
problem, GT-CADIS provides speedups of 200 ± 100 relative to global variance reduction with the Forward Weighted (FW)-CADIS method and 9 ± 5 · 10{\textasciicircum}4 relative to analog. This work shows that GT-CADIS is broadly applicable to FES problems and will significantly reduce the computational resources necessary for SDR
analysis.},

Because photon heating dominates the contribution to total nuclear heating for common materials like stainless steel and copper in several key components of ITER, the photon cross section library is particularly important. In this work, two ITER realistic benchmark calculation models are used to determine the impact on nuclear heating by the cross section library used in the calculation. The results show that the nuclear heating can be as much as 5\% lower to as much as 6\% higher than the nuclear heating calculated using the standard fusion neutron and photon cross section library.},

The integration of nuclear assessments (neutronics, shielding, and activation) is an essential element to ARIES-ACT2 success. This paper highlights the design philosophy of in-vessel components and characterizes several nuclear-related issues that have been addressed during the course of the study to improve the ARIES-ACT2 design: sufficient breeding of tritium to fuel the plasma, well-optimized in-vessel components that satisfy all design requirements and guarantee the shielding functionality of its radial/vertical builds, survivability of low-activation/radiation-resistant structural materials in 14-MeV neutron environment, activation concerns for RAFM and corrosion-resistant oxide-dispersion-strengthened alloys, and an integral approach to handle the mildly radioactive materials during operation and after decommissioning.},

High fidelity in nuclear results mandates performing state-of-the-art nuclear analyses.

This paper outlines several major nuclear issues addressed for the recently completed ARIES-ACT1 tokamak conceptual power plant study. An integral nuclear approach was deemed necessary to deliver an optimal design. This approach considered the overall configuration, design requirements (including tritium self-sufficiency), smart selection of low-activation material for all components, radial build optimization and definition, and safety and environmental concerns. This paper reports the main results of this integral approach that aims at considering several effects that influence the global behavior of a complex power plant such as ARIES-ACT1.},

Because of the high divertor operating temperatures and the low ductility of tungsten, thermal creep and fracture will be important failure mechanisms to consider. This paper presents a series of finite element analyses addressing the viable operating ranges of these tungsten plate divertor concepts with respect to creep and fracture. For fracture, the J-integral, a path-independent contour integral that estimates the strain energy release rate for a crack of assumed geometry, is used to address crack propagation. Elliptical surface cracks are introduced both inside and outside the coolant channel, and steady-state calculations are carried out for both full-power and cold shutdown conditions. It is determined that the critical crack is on the inside of the coolant channel with the highest stress intensities at full-power operation. Also, transient creep simulations are performed to predict the high-temperature thermal deformations and creep strains at various surface flux levels. Finally, transient thermal calculations are carried out to simulate edge-localized modes in the plasma, and conclusions are drawn with respect to the severity and frequency of these events with respect to surface melting for the two concepts.},

Given that the proposed Fusion Nuclear Science Facility (FNSF) will have different geometry and plasma parameters, it is necessary to address similar issues in that context. Hence, this paper presents two key results: the thermomechanical response of the first wall and divertor to expected FNSF ELMs and disruptions, and the electromagnetic response of all structures inside the FNSF vacuum vessel to a plasma current quench. Structures considered in the electromagnetic analyses include the vacuum vessel, blankets, structural ring (which supports many of the internal components), and all internal shells used for plasma stability and control. The first wall is a ferritic steel structure with a thin tungsten coating and the divertor is all tungsten. Properties used for the divertor are those of pure tungsten, though it is quite possible that some alloy or nanostructured material would be employed at some point. Both the first wall and divertor are gas-cooled, so coolant pressures are quite high (8–10MPa). The finite element code ANSYS is used to carry out all analyses and parametric studies are employed in order to identify parameters for which uncertainties will have a significant effect on the predicted performance. The ELM and disruption loads are found to be substantially smaller than those expected in a commercial reactor, so the component designs have more margin.},

The objective of this work is to develop a multiphysics modeling process in order to optimize the design and achieve long lifetime, maintainability, and high reliability. 3D finite element multiphysics modeling of the DCLL first wall and blanket (midplane of one sector) has been performed using COMSOL 5.2. The multiphysics aspect of the design is demonstrated via coupling of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), conjugate heat transfer and solid mechanics. Both normal and off-normal loading conditions have been analyzed. The results of velocity, pressure, and temperature distributions of helium flow, as well as the primary and thermal stress of the structure were obtained. This was followed by determination of the factors of safety along three critical paths based on the ITER Structural Design Criteria for In-vessel Components (ISDC-IC). We show here that the structural design meets the ITER-ISDC design rules under both normal and off-normal operating conditions, though the safety factors under off-normal condition with 8MPa helium pressure are marginal.

	abstract = {The amount and type of gaseous and metallic transmutants produced in tungsten (W) when used as a plasma-facing armor in magnetic (MFE) and inertial (IFE) confinement fusion systems were determined and compared to those obtained following irradiation in fission reactors. Up to ∽8\% metallic transmutants are generated at the expected lifetime of the fusion blanket. Irradiation in fission reactors to the same fast neutron fluence yields a much larger amount of metallic transmutation products than in fusion systems. While the dominant component in fusion systems is rhenium (Re), osmium (Os) is the main transmutation product in fission reactors. The impact on the W properties needs to be assessed. The results of this work will help guide irradiation experiments in fission reactors to properly simulate the conditions in fusion systems by possible direct implantation of transmutation products in irradiated samples. In addition, the results represent a necessary input for modeling activities aimed at understanding the expected effects on properties.},

	abstract = {Fusion power holds the promise of electricity production with a high degree of safety and low environmental impact. Favourable characteristics of fusion as an energy source provide the potential for this very good safety and environmental performance. But to fully realize the potential, attention must be paid in the design of a demonstration fusion power plant (DEMO) or a commercial power plant to minimize the radiological hazards. These hazards arise principally from the inventory of tritium and from materials that become activated by neutrons from the plasma. The confinement of these radioactive substances, and prevention of radiation exposure, are the primary goals of the safety approach for fusion, in order to minimize the potential for harm to personnel, the public, and the environment. The safety functions that are implemented in the design to achieve these goals are dependent on the performance of a range of materials. Degradation of the properties of materials can lead to challenges to key safety functions such as confinement. In this paper the principal types of material that have some role in safety are recalled. These either represent a potential source of hazard or contribute to the amelioration of hazards; in each case the related issues are reviewed. The resolution of these issues lead, in some instances, to requirements on materials specifications or to limits on their performance.},

	abstract = {The Fusion Nuclear Science Facility (FNSF) is examined here as part of a two step program from ITER to commercial power plants. This first step is considered mandatory to establish the materials and component database in the real fusion in-service environment before proceeding to larger electricity producing facilities. The FNSF can be shown to make tremendous advances beyond ITER, toward a power plant, particularly in plasma duration and fusion nuclear environment. A moderate FNSF is studied in detail, which does not generate net electricity, but does reach the power plant blanket operating temperatures. The full poloidal Dual Coolant Lead Lithium (DCLL) blanket is chosen, with alternates being the Helium Cooled Lead Lithium (HCLL) and Helium Cooled Ceramic Breeder/Pebble Bed (HCCB/PB). Several power plant relevant choices are made in order to follow the philosophy of targeted technologies. Any fusion core component must be qualified by fusion relevant neutron testing and highly integrated non-nuclear testing before it can be installed on the FNSF in order to avoid the high probability of constant failures in a plasma-vacuum system. A range of missions for the FNSF, or any fusion nuclear facility on the path toward fusion power plants, are established and characterized by several metrics. A conservative physics strategy is pursued to accommodate the transition to ultra-long plasma pulses, and parameters are chosen to represent the power plant regime to the extent possible. An operating space is identified, and from this, one point is chosen for further detailed analysis, with R=4.8m, a=1.2m, IP=7.9 MA, BT=7.5T, βN{\textless}2.7, n/nGr=0.9, fBS=0.52, q95=6.0, H98 ∼1.0, and Q=4.0. The operating space is shown to be robust to parameter variations. A program is established for the FNSF to show how the missions for the facility are met, with a He/H, a DD and 5 DT phases. The facility requires ∼25years to complete its DT operation, including 7.8 years of neutron production, and the remaining spent on inspections and maintenance. The DD phase is critical to establish the ultra-long plasma pulse lengths. The blanket testing strategy is examined, and shows that many sectors have penetrations for heating and current drive (H/CD), diagnostics, or Test Blanket Modules (TBMs). The hot cell is a critical facility element in order for the FNSF to perform its function of developing the in-service material and component database. The pre-FNSF R\&D is laid out in terms of priority topics, with the FNSF phases driving the time-lines for R\&D completion. A series of detailed technical assessments of the FNSF operating point are reported in this issue, showing the credibility of such a step, and more detailed emphasis on R\&D items to pursue. These include nuclear analysis, thermo-mechanics and thermal-hydraulics, liquid metal thermal hydraulics, transient thermo-mechanics, tritium analysis, maintenance assessment, magnet specification and analysis, materials assessments, core and scrape-off layer (SOL)/divertor plasma examinations.},

	abstract = {Tokamak power plants are studied with advanced and conservative design philosophies to identify the impacts on the resulting designs and to provide guidance to critical research needs. Incorporating updated physics understanding and using more sophisticated engineering and physics analysis, the tokamak configurations have developed a more credible basis compared with older studies. The advanced configuration assumes a self-cooled lead lithium blanket concept with SiC composite structural material with 58\% thermal conversion efficiency. This plasma has a major radius of 6.25 m, a toroidal field of 6.0 T, a q95 of 4.5,a βtotal N of 5.75, an H98 of 1.65, an n/nGr of 1.0, and a peak divertor heat flux of 13.7 MW/m2. The conservative configuration assumes a dual-coolant lead lithium blanket concept with reduced-activation ferritic martensitic steel structural material and helium coolant, achieving a thermal conversion efficiency of 45\%. The plasma has a major radius of 9.75 m, a toroidal field of 8.75 T, a q95 of 8.0, a βtotal N of 2.5, an H98 of 1.25, an n/nGr of 1.3, and a peak divertor heat flux of 10 MW/m2. The divertor heat flux treatment with a narrow power scrape-off width has driven the plasmas to larger major radius. Edge and divertor plasma simulations are targeting a basis for high radiated power fraction in the divertor, which is necessary for solutions to keep the peak heat flux in the range 10 to 15 MW/m2. Combinations of the advanced and conservative approaches show intermediate sizes. A new systems code using a database approach has been used and shows that the operating point is really an operating zone with some range of plasma and engineering parameters and very similar costs of electricity.

The tritium self-sufficiency, blanket testing, and materials testing are of particular interest since they define a critical element of the FNSF mission. There is a definitive need to breed the majority of, if not all, the tritium required for operation. A staged blanket testing strategy has been developed to test and enhance the blanket performance during each phase of operation. A materials testing module is critically important to include in FNSF to test large specimens of future generations of materials (for blanket, divertor, magnets, etc.) in relevant fusion environment. In this strategy, the test modules play a pivotal role and serve as “forerunners” for more advanced versions of blanket and materials that will validate their characteristics and features to assure the successful operation of DEMO and advanced power plants.},

	abstract = {The proposed Fusion Nuclear Science Facility (FNSF) represents the first facility to enter the complex fusion nuclear regime, and its technical mission and attributes are being developed. The FNSF represents one part of the fusion energy development pathway to the first commercial power plant with other major components being the pre-FNSF research and development, research in parallel with the FNSF, pre-DEMO research and development, and the demonstration power plant (DEMO). The Fusion Energy Systems Studies group is developing the technical basis for the FNSF in order to provide a better understanding of the demands on the fusion plasma and fusion nuclear science programs.},

	abstract = {The importance of handling the sizable mildly radioactive materials that fusion generates received more attention in recent years. Disposing such sizable radwaste in geologic repositories is not a viable option. We suggest changing what is now a costly waste disposal concern for fusion energy into a valued commodity through the further development of the recycling and clearance approaches. This paper reports the outcome of two recent activities that identified the challenges of handling the radioactive materials of ARIES-ACT-2 power plant along with the required design changes and R\&D programs that make the recycling/clearance approach a reality, and the development of a new detritiation code that predicts the efficiency of tritium recovery from metallic materials – an essential process before recycling.},

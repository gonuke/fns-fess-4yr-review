	abstract = {The MCR2S system is a tool for the analysis of activation dose in ITER and fusion devices based on the rigorous-2-step formalism, MCNP mesh-tallies and the FISPACT nuclear inventory code. It couples transport and activation calculations in an integrated manner, allowing for the necessarily fine energy and spatial resolutions required for this kind of analysis and overcoming limitations of previous similar tools. The system is routinely used at UKAEA to assist the design of several ITER components such as the ICRH heating system and LIDAR diagnostic. Here we describe its functionality and a first benchmark exercise performed using the fusion-relevant Frascati Neutron Generator shutdown dose rate experiment results. Neutron spectra, reaction rates, photon spectra and activation decay dose rates at several positions and times, obtained using FENDL-2.1/MC and EAF-2007 data, are presented and compared to those of earlier software and libraries, showing good agreement. C/E values close to unity are obtained in all cases, illustrating the robustness and reliability of this novel software. 2009 A. Davis.},

	abstract = {Analytic and Laplacian Adaptive Radioactivity Analysis (ALARA) is a new activation code released in January 1998 and developed for the analysis of radioactivity in fusion energy systems. ALARA has been validated by comparing it with other commonly used activation codes, FISPACT-97 and DKR-Pulsar 2.0, using the International Atomic Energy Agency Fusion Evaluated Nuclear Data Library Calculational Activation Benchmark. ALARA offers improvement over DKR because it is able to accurately model loops in the decay trees and calculate gas production. Compared to FISPACT-97, ALARA has many of the advantages of DKR, including the ability to exactly model pulsed irradiation histories and simultaneously calculate the solution at many spatial points.},

	abstract = {The SERPENT Monte Carlo code has the unique capability to simulate neutron and gamma transport using a stereolithography (STL) geometry. The STL geometry can model irregular complex geometries often encountered, for example, in research reactors. This geometry type can be used in combination with an unstructured mesh-based interface to couple SERPENT to OpenFOAM for CFD analyses. The STL file format also allows printing the geometry model with 3D printers. This work validates SERPENT simulations based on the STL geometry using the GIACINT critical experimental facility and the YALINA Thermal subcritical experimental facility. The results and performances of SERPENT have been compared with those of the well-known MCNP code. Finally, SERPENT computing time has been significantly reduced by using its mesh adaptive search algorithm, which has been introduced to optimize simulations based on the stereolithography STL geometry, and a hybrid modeling that mixes combinatorial and STL geometries. In this work, the STL geometry model of SERPENT involved the use of multiple software and programming languages, including: CUBIT, PYTHON, C, and MATLAB.},

Embree is explicitly designed to achieve high performance in professional rendering environments in which complex geometry and incoherent ray distributions are common. Embree consists of a set of low-level kernels that maximize utilization of modern CPU architectures, and an API which enables these kernels to be used in existing renderers with minimal programmer effort. In this paper, we describe the design goals and software architecture of Embree, and show that for secondary rays in particular, the performance of Embree is competitive with (and often higher than) existing state-of-the-art methods on CPUs and GPUs.},

	abstract = {A novel approach for the Monte Carlo based calculation of high resolution shutdown dose rate distributions was elaborated at KIT developing the previous R2Smesh technique. The method utilizes the MCNP code for particle transport calculations and the FISPACT code for the activity calculations providing the decay photon source distribution. The spatial distributions both of neutrons and decay photons are obtained by making use of the mesh tally technique available with MCNP5. This procedure has no limitation for the complexity of the geometry used for particle transport simulations. As a unique novelty, the present approach does not need a particle track output (PTRAC) file for the determination of the material composition in a mesh element. Instead a newly developed subroutine, linked to the MCNP code, takes care about the geometry cells, materials and their volume fractions in the mesh cell passing this information directly to the MCNP's mesh tally output file. The new approach is verified by means of benchmark calculations for JET and compared to the cell based rigorous 2 step (R2S) method. The results obtained fit very well experimental data. The successful application of the new interface to JET has demonstrated that this approach can be applied with confidence for shutdown dose rate assessments in ITER.},
